steps to switch a process  
1. Change protection domain (user to supervisor[kernel]).
2. Change stacks: switch from using the user-level stack to
using a kernel stack.
3. Save execution state (on kernelâ€™s stack).
4. Do kernel stuff
5. Kernel thread switch
6. Restore user-level execution state
7. Change protection domain (from supervisor[kernel] to user)
